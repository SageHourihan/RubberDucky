# RubberDucky
RubberDucky is a responsive front-end framework. Using Simplegrid for the layout, RubberDucky aims to be a simple minimalist framework that is built using Sass. It includes styles for buttons, tables, and form elements. Navbars and footers can be made easily with the use of the grid and styles can easily be added to other elements that aren't included like ul, li, sections, etc.
